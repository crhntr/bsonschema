# bsonschema [![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/crhntr/bsonschema.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/crhntr/bsonschema)

I had a complex document schema to maintain. It was rough. So this should help.

It does not do migrations or anything. It is just a DSL for generating bson schema documents.

It is missing a lot of functionality.
